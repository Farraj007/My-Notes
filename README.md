> You can't Achive a Goal without having it 


### Good-Developer-Mindset

The writer started his essay by bringging up a bunch of *statements* that are very familiar for the **developers** because they face it usually in their Development Career.

#### You should learn the Software **Mindset**

>There are many small factors that slowly and gradually harm a developer’s projects.

He mentioned that a very small error might grow to be a huge problem in you development life because you might not see it at the beginning or for years but they may seem harmless but don't let them stack up so they don't grow to a horror story, so ***you should learn the software mindest to become a good developer***



#### Here are some  key points to follow to be a good **Developer**:

-Fully understand the purpose of the software.

-What is Our goal in this project.

-Your design should be easy for youa and helpful for others.

- Fully Understand the tools and software you are using

-Simplicity ove Complexity. 

>A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.
>
>> A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.
>>
>>>The source of many software failures is complexity.

- Nothing goes Without Maintinance especially who Experience **Changes**

-Consistency is important and linked with Simiplicity *Keep it simple for the developers and consist * 

>In any team sport, the best teams have consistency and chemistry. — Roger Staubach
>
>> That reminds me of **FIFA Ultimate Team** 🕹️

- Making decisions if any change to your software is worth it or not. 

** You may Use this equation**

The equation is simple: D=V/E

>The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change. – Code Simplicity

- Think before act and try to Solve problems by understandig things right and simpliest way also.
 
 ### Always Plan your Path for writting the software **DON'T** be afraid ti start small you will build up on it. stay a step a head by Staying on the plant don't try to overthink afterwise or predict for the future do it for the present and don't put any assumbtion for the software to get wrong you coukd fix it then.

 ### Also as a developer if there is a working software is working just fine don't try to reinvent them only if they ain't good or using bad form keep them the same. The first reaction from a good developer should be **NO** for a cahnge becuase they work good. 

 ### Everything in your developing Life takes longer than you think, so try to over estimate things rather than underestimating them you should keep of mind also the testing time requierd try logging in in early stages to save time, also keep of mind Using longer lines ain't always the solution **Remember** the shorter the simplier the smarter you look. 
 
 > you won't need to write ***what*** in you syntax you would write ***why*** you used this syntax 
 >
 >>your code must be simple and easy to understand

## Try **NOT** to be dependant on external resources always think it out yourself

> It's not a problem using external resources but never make them your main source because they limit your thinking and might make your program complex and ***we don't need that***

# Don't Forget we work as a team don't be afraid to ask fpr help. This is a growing industry keep learning new tools new languages be **open minded** eager to learn new skills .
